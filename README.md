# PGR-Seminar

A cart-racing game for Game Seminar in Montreal.
Race your friends in a 2D Top-Down Downhill Jam experience. Maintain your max speed and try to screw up your competitors.

Main focuses:

Using ValveSockets C# to implement network functionality in Unity
Low level network programming, I created each of the data buffers that are sent over the network.
Full LAN Gameplay Support - Host/Client Architecture - No hole punching in this API
Unlimited number of players able to connect (Currently tested with eight concurrent players in a single game)
